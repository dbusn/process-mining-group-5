First part: read datasets and 
Read train, validation and test dataset

Function: assign_position(df: pd.DataFrame)
  Count the number of processes per trace/id and append it to a list called count_lst
  Make a new list for the positions called position_lst
  For each process in a trace
    Assign a position number
  Add a new colum to the dataframe and append the list of positions
  return dataframe
  
define df_train, df_val and df_test
Select the mode action for each row/process
Merge the training dataset with with the predicted actions based on their position in a case

Second part: apply prediction dataframe to validation and test dataset
Merge the validation set and the position dataframe
Sort the dataframe on the timestamp
And rename the colums: cencept:name_y to baseline_action_pred and concept:name_x to concept:name
Do steps 1 to 3 for the test set and position dataframe
